PAF requires third party software that is not included in PAF's source code
repository. PAF's configure and build system, `CMake`, will automatically
download, configure and build this third party software. As each of those
third party software comes with its own specific license, you have to check
their licenses complie with your own specific requirements.

 - `tarmac-trace-utilities <https://github.com/ARM-software/tarmac-trace-utilities>`_.
   licensed under https://github.com/ARM-software/tarmac-trace-utilities/blob/main/LICENSE.txt.
   This library provides PAF with the fondations for efficiently manipulating tarmac traces.

 - `GoogleTest <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_,
   licensed under https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/LICENSE.
   This is the framework used for unit testing PAF.
