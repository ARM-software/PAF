===============================================================================
PAF, the Physical Attack Framework
===============================================================================

Welcome to PAF ! PAF is a suite of tools and libraries to learn about physical
attacks, such as fault injection and side channels, and hopefully help harden
code bases against those threats.

Requirements
============

To build PAF from source, you will need a C++ compiler compatible with C++17,
and `CMake <https://cmake.org/>`_.

A significant number of the PAF tools assumes that you at least have access to
Tarmac traces. These are detailed traces of a program's execution, and they
are generated by a number of Arm products, like software models of CPUs (e.g.
FastModel).

PAF has the capability to directly drive a FastModel and perform a number of
analysis. In order to use this capability, you will need to have access to a
`FastModel
<https://developer.arm.com/tools-and-software/simulation-models/fast-models>`_


Building
========

The simplest way to build PAF is:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ cmake -S . -B build
  $ cmake --build build

A slightly more evolved way of building and testing PAF, in release mode with
debug info, using the ``clang`` compiler, ``Ninja`` build system and producing
a ``compile_commands.json`` file looks like:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
         -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RelWithDebInfo \
         -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=ON
  $ ln -s build/compile_commands.json .
  $ ninja -C build/
  $ ninja -C build/ test

Testing
=======

PAF contains both unit testing and application level testing. Unit testing can
be performed using the ``test`` target, with no external dependencies.
Application level testing is a different story as it requires access to a
cross-compiler and a FastModel. If you have access to those, ``CMake`` can
setup a test environment for you with:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ CC=clang CXX=clang++ cmake -S . -B build -G Ninja \
         -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=RelWithDebInfo \
         -DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPILE_COMMANDS:BOOL=ON \
         -DFVP_MODEL_DIR:PATH=/opt/FastModels/11.12/FVP_MPS2_Cortex-M3_CC312/models/Linux64_GCC-6.4/FVP_MPS2_Cortex-M3_CC312 \
         -DFVP_PLUGINS_DIR:PATH=/opt/FastModels/11.12/FastModelsPortfolio_11.12/plugins/Linux64_GCC-6.4 \
         -DARM_GCC_INSTALL_DIR:PATH=/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-10-2020-q4-major

Usage and documentation
=======================

For more information on PAF, the tools it provides and how to use them, see the
`main documentation <doc/index.rst>`_.

License
=======

PAF is distributed under the `Apache v2.0 License
<http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0>`_.

Third party software
====================

PAF uses third party software that is not included in PAF's source code
repository. PAF's configure and build system, `CMake`, will automatically
download, configure and build this third party software. As each of those
third party software comes with its own specific license, you have to check
their licenses comply with your own specific requirements.

The third party software required by PAF is:

- `tarmac-trace-utilities <https://github.com/ARM-software/tarmac-trace-utilities>`_,
  licensed under https://github.com/ARM-software/tarmac-trace-utilities/blob/main/LICENSE.txt,
  is the library that provides PAF with the fondations for efficiently manipulating tarmac traces.

- `pyyaml <https://pypi.org/project/PyYAML/>`_,
  and `pyelftools <https://pypi.org/project/pyelftools/>`_,
  and `tqdm <https://pypi.org/project/tqdm/>`_ are used by ``run-model.py`` and ancillary tools.

- `GoogleTest <https://github.com/google/googletest>`_,
  licensed under https://github.com/google/googletest/blob/main/LICENSE,
  is the unit testing framework used by PAF.

- `numpy <https://numpy.org/>`_, licensed under https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/main/LICENSE.txt,
  is used by some unit tests.

Other third party software that can optionally be used by PAF with PAF's
configure and build system:

- `GTKWave <https://github.com/gtkwave/gtkwave>`_ : PAF uses the `fstapi` to
  have support for `fst` files, as shipped by ``GTKWave`` in the ``src/helpers/fst``
  folder. Quoting GTKWave's `LICENSE.txt` file::

    the dumpfile processing source code in ``src/helpers`` is licensed under the MIT
    license in order to facilitate greater re-use.

  The default is for CMake to use the `fstapi`. This can however be disabled by passing
  at configure time `-DWITH_GTKWAVE_FST_SUPPORT:BOOL=OFF` to drop `fst` file
  format support.

Security
========

To report security vulnerabilities in this project, follow the guidance in the
`security policy <SECURITY.rst>`_.
